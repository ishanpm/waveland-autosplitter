# waveland-autosplitter
A short autosplitter for the Waveland demo (https://rologfos.com/demo)

Splits (each one is toggleable and repeats):
- Enter 1-1
- Finish a level
- Enter final cutscene

To use it, download the .asl file, create a "Scriptable Auto Splitter" component in the Edit Layout menu, and point it towards the file.

Currently, it only works with the demo, and cannot auto-start the run (the option does nothing), so you still need to do that yourself.
